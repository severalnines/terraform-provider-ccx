# CCX Provider

Warning! Be careful when recreating servics using Terraform. Terraform may delete services / instances before creating them. Ensure you do not have an existing .tfstate file before you run terrafom.

Sign up for CCX at https://ccx.severalnines.com/ and use the username/password below,
Create a Terraform file called datastore.tf with the content below (see Example Usage). You must set username,
password and you may change cluster_name,db_vendor,region, and instance_size (tiny, small, medium, large).

More documenation can be found at https://github.com/severalnines/terraform-provider-ccx.

## Limitations
- Authentication is limited to username/password
- Only 1 or 3 nodes are supported

## Example Usage

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    ccx = {
      source  = "severalnines/ccx"
      version = "~> 0.0.1"
    }
  }
}
provider "ccx" {
    username = "USERNAME"
    password = "PASSWORD"
}
resource "ccx_cluster" "CLUSTERNAME" {
    cluster_name = "CLUSTERNAME"
    cluster_size = 1
    db_vendor = "percona"
    tags = ["production"]
    cloud_provider = "aws"
    region = "eu-west-1"
    instance_size = "tiny"
    volume_size =  20
    volume_iops = 300
    volume_type = "gp2"
    network_type = "public"
}
```
Optionally you can specify to create a VPC (supported by AWS, GCP)
```
resource "ccx_vpc" "newVpc" {
    vpc_name = "spaceforce_vpc"
    vpc_cloud_provider = "aws"
    vpc_cloud_region = "eu-north-1"
    vpc_ipv4_cidr = "10.10.0.0/16"
}
```
In that case set:
```
    network_type = "private"
    network_vpc_uuid =ccx_vpc.newVpc.id
```
in the resource "ccx_cluster" section.
